# Sustainable Concrete via Bayesian Optimization

The goal of the repository is to invite researchers and pracitioners
in both machine learning and civil engineering to collaborate on making
concrete production more sustainable.
Responsible for up to 8% of global carbon dioxide emissions yearly,
compared to less than 3% for all air travel,
concrete production needs to be decarbonized to achieve
a sustainable future.

This package contains probabilistic models and data for the
1) compressive strength of concrete / mortar and
2) the associated global warming potential (GWP),

as a function of their composition, consisting of
cement, slag, water, to name a few basic ingredients.
